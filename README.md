**MeloLearn 🎶**

Because learning should sound as cool as your playlist.

Welcome to MeloLearn, a fun, audio-powered learning platform by Harshini BV, where you learn, listen, edit, and vibe your way through knowledge.
Your journey officially begins at NOW.html, because learning starts NOW, not tomorrow. 😉

**🚀 What is MeloLearn?**

MeloLearn is a playful, interactive platform designed to mix education with audio creativity.
It's basically a place where:

You click buttons ✨

Sounds play 🎧

You learn things 📚

You edit audio like a movie hacker ⚡

Perfect for students, creators, and multitaskers who want learning to feel less boring.

**🔥 Features**

⭐ NOW.html is the main homepage — dramatic & important.

🎧 Audio lessons (mp3 files included... well, some of them — see below).

🎨 Multiple pages like learn.html, listen.html, create.html, edit Audio.html.

🎛️ Audio tools: trim, reverse, voice-change — your mini audio lab.

📚 Courses redirect to new1.html as intended.

🖼️ Clean UI with HTML, CSS, JS and a structured project flow.

**❗ Important Note
**
I could not upload all the MP3 songs because GitHub said

“Bruh… no more space.”

So only a limited number of audio files are included in the repo.
The remaining files are stored locally and can be added manually if needed.
